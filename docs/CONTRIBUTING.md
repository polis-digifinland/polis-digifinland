## Submitting general improvements

Please send a [GitHub Pull Request to Polis DF](https://github.com/polis-digifinland/polis-digifinland/pull/new/master) with a clear list of what you've done (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)).

Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:
